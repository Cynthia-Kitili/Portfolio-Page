            <p class="about">About Me</p>
            <P>I am pursuing a course in <strong>Electrical and Electronics Engineering.</strong>  I have a passion for electronics which has led me to the field of <em>Software development</em> through programming. I love the fact that technology is dynamic and everyday poses new inventions thus new learning opportunities. I believe that anyone can be anything especially if they have determination, self-control and passion because I am living proof that hardwork pays. I love giving out to the community and I started a group that unites people so that they can give back.</P>

         <div class="reason">
            <p>I developed an interest in programming right after I studied c++ and c programming in Jomo Kenyatta University and I wanted to find out more about other programming languages. This burning desire led me to Moringa School which is a very interesting school which teaches students how to learn on their own,through pair programming,through groups and to find ways to solve problems on their own. I love how through programming alot of things can be done especially in the field of Robotics, Website Development and Android Development just to mention a few.</p>
